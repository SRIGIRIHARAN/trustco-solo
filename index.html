            “I think you're better off finding the money to hire someone than
            actually find a co-founder. The main reason? You probably won't find
            someone as passionate as you are about the organization you're
            building. And keep in mind, I have no clue who you are or what
            you're building so that's no judgment on you or the idea, just the
            reality I've observed over 20 years of startups.”
